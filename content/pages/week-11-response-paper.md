*The Challenge*: How have you personally observed or experienced the challenges described in the resources for this week? What did you learn from these resources that you didn't know before? 

*The Tool*: What did you learn from your audits of the class syllabus, and your own bibliography? How did you feel about the exercise of looking for new sources to cite? Was the task difficult or uncomfortable? Did PANNing give you any new insights? Did you learn something new about MIT, SoS, and BCS programs?

*Critical evaluation of the tool*: Will audits and conscious efforts be effective in creating scientific communities that are more open to contributions and scrutiny from all people, regardless of accidents of birth? What are the limits of these tools and what other change do we need?  

*This response paper should be about 1-page long, single-spaced. Total points: 3.*
