## The Tool

*Practical skills assignment*

1. Look at a science graphics website, like [biorender](https://biorender.com). Is there an image that would help you communicate your own research in clear and appealing graphics?
2. Find a non-traditional format for scientific communication (one of the following: an interactive Notebook, a [cartoon paper](https://twitter.com/econimate), a [video abstract](https://libraries.ou.edu/content/make-video-abstract-your-research), '[two-minute paper](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg)', a podcast, an [oral story](https://www.storycollider.org), Twitter thread, [dance](https://www.science.org/content/article/watch-winners-year-s-dance-your-phd-contest), OR a blog post), and the associated paper. Give an example of something that is communicated more clearly in the non-traditional format. 
3. Find a figure or image on your, or your lab's, website or social media feed that doesn't have [Alt Text (image description)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19640-w). Draft [good Alt Text](https://help.siteimprove.com/support/solutions/articles/80000863904) (or actually add it!).
4. For a paper you know well, draft one of the following: an interactive executable paper, a cartoon paper, a video abstract, a 'two-minute paper', a podcast, an oral story, a Twitter thread OR a blog post. This can be a draft; you're not required to make a finished project. Attach your product with your response paper. Explicitly say who is your [intended audience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0516-1).
