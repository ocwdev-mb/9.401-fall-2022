*The Challenge: Scientific papers are obsolete*. How can we make science more accessible to a broader public, including non-expert readers from neighboring disciplines, students, and the public with varying levels of expertise? What is the role of graphic design, visual communication, and other 'non-traditional' modes of scientific communication in our work?

*The Tool: Alternative and non-traditional formats for scientific communication.* What did you accomplish in the practical activity? Did you find something that would help you communicate your or another's research more clearly in the non-traditional format?

*Critical evaluation of the tool.*Â 

This response paper should be about 1-page long, single-spaced. Total points: 3.
