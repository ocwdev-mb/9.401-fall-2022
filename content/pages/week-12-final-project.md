Students taking the class for credit will do a final project. There are many options for the format of this project, including an essay on a topic related to the class, or a project developing or applying one of the tools discussed in the class.

If you're taking the course for credit and have completed a final project, please upload your slides, and any documents or other products you created as part of your project by the due date. It is expected that from your slides, we will be able to understand what the other documents are, and how they are relevant to or constitute a project for this class.
