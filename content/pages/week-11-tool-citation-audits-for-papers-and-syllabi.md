## The Tool

*Practical skills assignment*

1. Do a diversity audit for the syllabus of this class, This is a {{% resource_link "124f3013-7404-400c-88b7-d4e6083dc4b0" "machine-readable bibliography of the main texts \[TXT\]" %}}, and for a bibliography in a paper by you or from your lab.  [One option for code and instructions is here](https://github.com/dalejn/cleanBib) (you may need {{% resource_link "82856424-2421-4a1b-83d8-84f5f4a82cf9" "this template file \[TEX\]" %}} as well because it checks it against a manuscript) or [another version is here](https://jlsumner.shinyapps.io/syllabustool/).
2. Suggest one replacement for an assigned reading or resource that would increase the diversity of authors in this class's syllabus in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, geography, or institution, e.g. researchers working in the global south or at HBCUs (Historically black colleges and universities).
3. Find a paper you could cite in your next paper, that is topically relevant and would increase the diversity of authors in your bibliography, by gender, race/ethnicity, geography, or institution. 
4. Read PANNING pdf, practice at least one of the 'engaging skills' at the end of the pdf, in a meeting, class, or on Twitter etc. [PANNING Excercise (PDF)](https://drkathyobear.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/microaggression-handouts-v2.pdf) on pp 3-4. 
5. Look into the DEI work that MIT and BCS are doing, by looking at the [BCS DEIJ website](https://bcs.mit.edu/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-bcs-and-building-46), the [School of Science website](https://science.mit.edu/diversity-and-inclusion/), the [ICEO website](https://iceo.mit.edu/mit-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-data/), and/or the [institutional research dashboard](https://ir.mit.edu/diversity-dashboard).  Did you find anything surprising? Programs or resources you wish more people knew about? Anything that should be there but isn't?
