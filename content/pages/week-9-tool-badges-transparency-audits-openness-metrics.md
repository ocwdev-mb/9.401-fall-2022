## The Tool

*Practical skills activity*

1. Here is the job description for [the open tenure-track position in BCS and Picower](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/22653). In response to input from last year's class, the language has been updated. What do you think of the current nod to open science? What changes would you recommend?
2. Look at the BCS and School of Science websites. How could these organizations express commitments to open science that would fulfill e.g. the Wellcome Trust "[guidance](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/research-organisations-how-implement-responsible-and-fair-approaches-research)"? Suggest language, and where it would go on the website. 
3. Find a journal that uses [Open Science badges](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/badges), and find a paper that has badges. Do the authors include the corresponding badge on their CV or website? 
4. Find an author in a discipline close to yours who advertises their open science practices on their CV or personal website.

- MIT has a longstanding relationship with an external company called Academic Analytics. But the use of this company's data in academic decision-making at other institutions is controversial.
