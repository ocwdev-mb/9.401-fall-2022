*The Challenge: Mistakes go uncaught and uncorrected.* Incorrect information or interpretations can be introduced into the literature and persist for a while; but ideally, these errors will be found and weeded out. This paragraph could describe something specific you learned from the readings you didn't already know, and/or a personal experience you've had that really brought home the challenge of science as self-correcting.

*The Tool: Dynamic executable paper*. Describe what you did in fulfilling this activity. What snags did you hit? What made this process easier or more difficult? Did you find any errors?

- Download RStudio and complete the RMarkDown lessons. Try producing a figure from data you've collected or data from your lab. If you don't have access to such data, find an openly shared RMarkDown document and reproduce a figure from that paper.
- Download Zotero if you don't already have it, and check for retracted papers. If none are flagged, add a retracted paper from Retraction Watch and see if Zotero correctly flags it as retracted. Is this flag noticeable enough to be a useful tool in preventing use of retracted papers?

*Critical evaluation of the tool*. What is the promise of this tool in addressing this challenge? What are the biggest obstacles? 

*This response paper should be about 1-page long, single-spaced. Total points: 3.*
